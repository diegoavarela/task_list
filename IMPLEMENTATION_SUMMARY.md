- ✅ react-big-calendar + moment - Calendar functionality
- ✅ Recharts - Analytics and charting
- ✅ date-fns - Date manipulation utilities
- ✅ Lucide React - Icon system

### Backend Infrastructure (Created but needs fixes)
- 🔧 Express.js + TypeScript - API server (has type errors)
- 🔧 PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM - Database layer
- 🔧 JWT Authentication - Security layer
- 🔧 Socket.IO - Real-time features
- 🔧 Multi-tenant architecture

## 📱 Mobile & Tablet Compatibility
- ✅ Responsive design implemented across all components
